## :three: Project Overview

:memo: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/FrBXcG1x/labs-24-d8picker)

:memo: [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/School-Calendar-4f6d59c69ed5456c9b78174ac6292e00)

School Calendar was an app idea brought to Lambda from a high school basketball coach. 
The coach would like a calendar that would make it easy for him to schedule events that have an irregular schedule. 
Currently on Google Calendar, you can set an event to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, etc, 
but to create an event that repeats, for example, 3 times a week and has a different start/end time depending 
on the day of the week, the user has to create each event manually. As a result, it takes the coach a long time 
to schedule practice sessions for his teams each time a new season starts.

Along with increased efficiency in creating events that have an irregular schedule, the coach would like
an easy way to notify the teams of upcoming practice sessions, games, workout sessions, as well as 
any changes made to previously-scheduled events.


## 4️⃣ Key Features

-    User authentication with Google Sign In
-    Create, Edit, and Delete events (templates that can be reused across multiple days)
-    Create, Edit, and Delete event dates (actual events created from event templates that show up on the calendar view)
-    Display upcoming event dates
-    Sync event dates to admin's Google Calendar
-    Toaster notifications (user feedback in admin flow)
-    Easily create new event dates from past event templates
-    Create, Edit, and Delete groups (teams)
-    Add contacts (the admin can add a contact and their info)
-    Add contacts via an invite link (the contacts themselves can fill out their info)
-    Assign and remove contacts from groups
-    Assign an entire group to an event

### Coming soon

-    Send SMS notifications to contacts about relevant events (work in progress)
-    Day, Week, Season, and Year calendar views (future release)
-    Add attachments to events (future release)


## :five: Tech Stack

### Front End built using:

#### React

-    Provides good code bases for things like calendars.
-    Group knowledge of it.
-    Hooks makes things more simple.
-    Context API provides state-management and seemlessly intergrates with browser's local storage

#### Styled-Components

-   Easy to implement custom UX design

#### Chakra-UI

-   Legacy
-   Used to build and render the calendar itself

#### Component composition

-   [Overview of component tree](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/view/a4ece8db-5341-47c1-923e-bb0e05734e1c/YGcM5DNywbTK)  

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

-   Continuous integration makes deploying new features and bug fixes easy

### Back End build using:

#### Node.JS

-   Provides an easy way to implement code following MVC model
-   Knex JS allows simple and flexible query-building
-   API routes are implemented using Express

#### PostgreSQL

-   Powerful and reliable
-   Production database

#### SQLite

-   Light, portable, easy to set up and get started
-   Development database
-   Testing database
  
#### Back end deployed to `Heroku`

-   Continuous integration makes deploying new features and bug fixes easy
  

## :six: Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. 
These variables are stored securely on Heroku.

REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID  
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY  
REACT_APP_BASE_URL  
REACT_APP_ENDPOINT_URL  

## :seven: Open Questions ❓

-   Can the application push existing calendars and/or events to a user's Apple Calendar or other calendars?
-   Imagine a calendar is full of events, how can a user search for a particular event? 
Should the search algorithm be built from scratch or using existing third-party service such as Algolia?
